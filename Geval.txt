You will be given one code answer for a math question.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of this answer from three perspectives:

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Correctness (1-5): Does the code correctly solve the problem as described?
Efficiency (1-5): How efficient is the code in terms of time and space complexity?
Readability (1-5): Is the code easy to read and understand? Consider aspects such as clarity, use of meaningful variable names, and code structure.

After run the code the result is : {{Result}}

For the question:

\n\n{{Question}}\n\n.

Here is the code answer for this question:

\n\n{{Answer}}.

Evaluation Steps:

Correctness: Check if the code produces the correct output for the given problem.
Efficiency: Analyze the code's efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.
Readability: Evaluate how easy the code is to read and understand.
Provide a score for each criterion from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest. Please only output the content after output.
